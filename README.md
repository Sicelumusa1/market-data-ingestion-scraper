# market-data-ingestion-scraper
This repository contains a standalone data ingestion service responsible for collecting daily fresh produce market data from a public market website.

The scraper extracts crop-level pricing, packaging types, daily volumes sold, cumulative monthly volumes, and revenue figures, and stores the data as raw CSV files.

The output of this service serves as the raw ingestion layer for a downstream data engineering pipeline focused on agricultural market intelligence and analytics.
